### Product Images & Designs

## Weight Variation Disclaimer (Made-to-Order Jewellery)

- Certain jewellery pieces are crafted **on order** to ensure precision, freshness of manufacture, and quality finishing. Due to natural **manufacturing tolerances** involved in jewellery production—such as casting, polishing, stone setting, and finishing—the final weight of a made-to-order product may differ slightly from the weight mentioned on the product page.
- As a result, the **actual delivered weight may vary by up to ±0.1 gram** from the stated weight. This minor variation is considered normal and does not affect the purity, quality, or overall value of the jewellery.
- We maintain strict quality control standards to ensure that any such variation remains minimal and within acceptable industry limits. Customers are encouraged to view the listed weight as an **approximate reference** for made-to-order items.
- For ready-stock products, the mentioned weight reflects the actual product weight unless otherwise stated.
- The final invoice and valuation are prepared based on the actual finished weight of the product.
