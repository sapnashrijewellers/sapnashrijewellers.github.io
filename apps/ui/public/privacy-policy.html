      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Sapna Shri Jewellers — Effective date: October 29, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Sapna Shri Jewellers</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores and discloses information when you use our Progressive Web App (PWA) and the Android app (TWA) that wraps it. Our website and app are intended as a public catalogue of products; we do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information except for push notification subscription details as described below.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Summary (short)</h2>
    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>We only collect push notification subscription data (required to deliver browser/app push).</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use cookies, analytics, or user tracking.</li>
        <li>Hosting: GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Workers &amp; KV (free tier) are used to serve the site and store push subscription objects.</li>
        <li>You can unsubscribe from push notifications at any time via the app or your browser settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Push subscription data only.</strong> When you opt in to receive push notifications we will store the minimal subscription information required to send pushes. This typically includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Endpoint URL</strong> — the push service endpoint (a URL managed by the browser or platform).</li>
        <li><strong>Public key / cryptographic keys</strong> (e.g. <code>p256dh</code> and <code>auth</code> tokens) used for encrypted push delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional metadata</strong> such as a timestamp when you subscribed and the approximate platform (e.g. "android" or "web").</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email, phone number, location, payment information, or any other personal identifiers as part of normal site usage.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>How we use the information</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Subscription data is used solely to deliver push notifications that you have explicitly opted into. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Announcements about new collections or offers.</li>
        <li>Order or service related push messages only if you opted in in a different flow (this site does not collect order data by default).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use subscription data for profiling, advertising, or third-party marketing.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Storage &amp; hosting</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Your subscription data is stored on Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare KV (free tier) that we operate. Cloudflare may process or cache requests as described in their policies. Static site hosting is provided by GitHub Pages. These services are independent third-party providers and have their own privacy and security practices.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> We retain push subscription entries only as long as necessary to send notifications and until you unsubscribe. If a subscription becomes invalid or expired, we remove it upon detection or at routine cleanup.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Cookies &amp; tracking</h2>
    <section>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use cookies for analytics or tracking. We do not embed third-party analytics or advertising scripts in the default site. If third-party widgets (e.g., chat or analytics) are added in the future we will update this policy and disclose their behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Third parties</h2>
    <section>
      <p>We may use third-party services to host or deliver content (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare). These services process the data required to deliver notifications or host the site. We do not share subscription data with advertisers or analytics companies. Third parties that do process the data do so as processors on our behalf; their access is limited to performing the service (sending push messages or serving site content).</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Your rights &amp; choices</h2>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Unsubscribe from push notifications:</strong> You can revoke push permission in multiple ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the app or site and use the provided unsubscribe control (if present).</li>
        <li>From your browser or Android app settings, disable notifications for Sapna Shri Jewellers.</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the Android app or clearing site permissions will also stop pushes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To request deletion of any stored subscription data, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sapnashrijewellers.in">privacy@sapnashrijewellers.in</a> (replace with your official contact). We will respond to verifiable requests to remove your subscription entry.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <section>
      <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect stored subscription data. Access to the push subscription store (Cloudflare Workers &amp; KV) is restricted to authorized systems. However, no internet transmission can be guaranteed 100% secure — if you believe your subscription data has been compromised, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:privacy@sapnashrijewellers.in">privacy@sapnashrijewellers.in</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Our site and app are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly target children under 13. We do not intentionally collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided subscription information, please contact us to request removal.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <section>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Effective date" at the top will reflect the last revision. Significant changes will be posted on this page. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
