title: Warranty Policy
---
All our products come with a **6-month limited warranty** from the date of purchase, applicable under normal use and proper care. 
This warranty covers **manufacturing defects and workmanship issues only** and is limited strictly to **repair services**; **returns, refunds, or replacements are not covered** under warranty. 
The warranty does not apply to damage caused by wear and tear, misuse, accidental damage, exposure to chemicals, water damage (where not specified), improper storage, alterations by third parties, or loss of stones or parts due to negligence. 
Any repair under warranty will be carried out at our discretion after inspection, and transportation or handling costs, if any, may be borne by the customer. 
Proof of purchase is mandatory to claim warranty benefits.

## Inspection & Decision Authority

All warranty claims are subject to a thorough inspection by our authorized personnel to assess the nature and cause of the issue. 
The determination of whether a product qualifies for warranty repair shall be made solely at our discretion based on this inspection. 
This process ensures fair evaluation and compliance with standard trade practices, and our decision shall be final in accordance with applicable consumer protection norms.

## Transit & Handling Costs

The warranty covers repair of eligible manufacturing defects only and does not include transportation, shipping, insurance, or handling charges. 
Any costs incurred for sending the product to and from our service location shall be borne by the customer, unless otherwise agreed in writing. 
This clarification is provided to maintain transparency and avoid disputes related to incidental expenses.

## Proof of Purchase Requirement

To avail warranty services, customers must present a valid proof of purchase such as an invoice, receipt, or order confirmation clearly indicating the purchase date. 
Warranty eligibility is calculated strictly from the original date of purchase. 
In the absence of valid proof, we reserve the right to deny warranty service, in line with standard industry practices and consumer law guidelines.

## Warranty Exclusions

This limited warranty does not cover damage resulting from normal wear and tear, improper use, mishandling, accidental damage, exposure to chemicals or moisture, improper storage, unauthorized modifications, third-party repairs, or loss of stones, parts, or finish due to negligence. 
Such exclusions are standard for jewellery and lifestyle products and are disclosed to ensure informed purchasing and responsible product use.
